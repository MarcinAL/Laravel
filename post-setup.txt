Post-setup instructions for LaravelContainer
-------------------------------------------

1. In the host directory `LaravelContainer`, remove the blocking file:
   rm ./laravel-app/.gitkeep
   # This file prevents Laravel installation.

   # Just in case throw also this
   rm ./db/.gitkeep
   rm ./mysql-data/.gitkeep

2. Enter the container filesystem:
   docker compose exec app bash

3. Install Laravel in the current directory (/var/www/html):
   composer create-project laravel/laravel .

4. Seed database tables (if you have seeders):
   php artisan db:seed

5. Set proper ownership for storage and cache directories:
   chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
   # Alternatively, for development you can use: chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache

6. Check the Laravel index page in your browser:
   http://{your host IP address}:8000
